## About me
Bachelor student in teaching German and dedicated linguist, who decided to change careers. I don't have a strong background, considering my age, but I keen on languages and everything I do. 

I'm interested in frontend because I've always enjoyed exploring website's functionality. I believe that with my diligence and curiosity I'll be able to make them myself.

## Code Example

function multiply(a, b){
  return a * b
}
```

## Work Experience
