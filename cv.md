## About me
Bachelor student in teaching German and dedicated linguist, who decided to change careers. I don't have a strong background, considering my age, but I keen on languages and everything I do. 

I'm interested in frontend because I've always enjoyed looking at unusual websites and explore their functionality. I believe that with my diligence and curiosity I'm able to create such websites myself.
